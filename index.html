  The federal budget, which is changed each year to accommodate the needs of the nation, never allocates enough for infrastructure. 
  Departments dealing with military and security receive tens if not hundreds of billions of dollars. Those are incredibly important areas of course; 
  without them our nation would not be a place where citizens can be free and happy. But what about making people feel safe <b>inside</b> our borders? Once the military and homeland security and all those other agencies secure us from malicious attacks, what is going to stop the degradation of everything surrounding us? 
  Despite the grave report given by the ASCE (see Details About Infrastructure tab), the departments in government which deal with infrastructure (energy, housing and urban development (HUD), education) receive far less than defense. For the 2020 fiscal year, President Trump has already proposed a budget [2] which gives the Department of Defense (DoD) $750 billion and Homeland Security $89.6 billion. In contrast, the Department of Energy is given $31.7 billion and HUD is given $37.6 billion.
  Education is given $62 billion but even this does not amount much to the DoDâ€™s budget. This discrepancy is unacceptable, and much more must be given to the departments in charge of maintaining and fixing infrastructure. This investment in infrastructure is not only beneficial to the safety of the American people, but it is also a great way to stimulate the economy. 
  According to a 2011 research done by University of Massachusetts, Amherst [3], a billion dollars given to military results in about 11,000 jobs made, while areas such as clean energy created around 16,000 jobs. 
  A billion dollars in education created roughly 27,000 jobs! 
  With all this job creation, putting money in infrastructure is a fantastic way to make America safer, and more profitable.
